                                Iron is a grey, metallic, silvery metal. Pure iron is soft and very malleable. Iron is
                                the end point of nuclear reactions in large stars. It is the last element to be
                                produced before the violent collapse of a supernova scatters the iron into space. Iron
                                reacts with most acids like sulfuric acid. It makes ferrous sulfate when reacted with
                                sulfuric acid.

                        Mercury is a terrestrial planet, meaning that it is composed of silicate minerals and metals
                        that are differentiated into an iron core and silicate mantle and crust. But unlike the other
                        rocky planets of the solar system, iron makes up a disproportionately large amount of the
                        planet. Even though the planet is small, Mercury is very dense. Each cubic centimetre has a
                        density of 5.4 grams, with only the Earth having a higher density. This is largely due to
                        Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of
                        Earth, this is too little to hold on to the atmosphere it has which is blown away by solar
                        winds. However, while gases escape into space they are constantly being replenished at the same
                        time by the same solar winds, radioactive decay and dust caused by micrometeorites.
