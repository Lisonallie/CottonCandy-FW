                                Composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium, the massive Jupiter is much like a tiny
                                star. But despite the fact that it is the largest planet in the solar system, the gas
                                giant just doesn't have the mass needed to push it into stellar status. When scientists
                                call Jupiter a gas giant, they aren't exaggerating.

                        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant
                        planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the
                        other planets in the Solar System combined. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into
                        several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting
                        boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have
                        existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Jupiter has 79
                        known moons. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet
                        Mercury. Chunks of diamonds may be floating in hydrogen and helium fluid deep in the atmospheres
                        of Saturn and Jupiter and the extreme pressure and temperature can melt the precious gem, making
                        it rain liquid diamond.
